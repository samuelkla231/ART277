  <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Basketball — The Court Life</h2>
  <p style="border: 2px solid #ffcc00; padding:12px; background-color: #fff8e1;">
    I started playing basketball at twelve and the game has shaped me a lot.
    It taught me discipline, teamwork, and confidence. When I step on the court I feel focused and unstoppable.

  <h2>School — My Field</h2>
  <p style="border-left:4px solid rgb(100,150,200); padding:10px 12px; margin-top:10px;">
    I’m currently studying System Administration, where I’m learning how to manage, maintain, and secure computer systems and networks. I enjoy understanding how servers, databases, and operating systems work together to keep everything running smoothly. Alongside that, I have a strong passion for <b>Web Development</b>

  <h3>Balancing Basketball and School</h3>
  <p>
    I balance basketball and school by keeping a steady routine — I attend classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then focus on basketball training on Tuesday and Thursday. This schedule helps me stay disciplined and give my best to both.
